# AntiSpam Extension for Yii 2

This extension provides form anti-spam features for the [Yii 2.0 framework](http://www.yiiframework.com).

For license information check the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

Documentation is at [docs/index.md](docs/index.md).

## Copyright

This extension was inspired by [BeastBytes/yii2-anti-spam](https://github.com/beastbytes/yii2-anti-spam)

BeastBytes' extension relies on modifications to the view files to work. If a lot of existing forms are to be modified,
this can be a lot of work. This extension aims to provide the same functionality without the need to modify the view
files.

To achieve this, this extension uses a custom ActiveField and multiple Traits which extend the default
ActiveField / ActiveRecord / Model / DynamicModal classes. The custom ActiveField class adds the necessary hidden fields
to the form and the Traits handle the attributes / validation

If extending the default ActiveField class is not an option, BeastBytes' original extension should be used.
